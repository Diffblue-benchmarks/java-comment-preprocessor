JCPreprocessor
---------------

Author: Igor Maznitsa (http://www.igormaznitsa.com)

The JCPreprocessor (Java Comment Preprocessor) is a very powerful multi-pass preprocessor supports loops and file generation features. Since it keeps its directives inside comment strings it can be used without problems in any Java IDE.
The first version of the JCPreprocessor was developed by Igor Maznitsa in 2002 and was used in dozens of mobile application projects for well-known trademarks. 
In 2011 it had been totally refactored and the MAVEN support was added, then sour—Åes were opened as an OSS project.
At present it can be used as:
 - A Maven Plugin
 - An ANT task
 - A Standalone application called through command line

The preprocessor is an open source project and its home page is http://code.google.com/p/java-comment-preprocessor/ where you can find new versions and wiki. 
Since 2011 the preprocessor was distributed under GNU LGPL v3 license but since 2014 and the 5.5.3 version it is distributed under Apache License 2.0

Usage from Maven
------------------
You can install directly the plugin into your local maven repository with the install:install-file goal:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./jcp-5.3.2.jar -DpomFile=./pom.xml


Since version 5.3.2 I public the plugin in the central Maven repository:
<build>
  <plugins>
...
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.igormaznitsa</groupId>
                <artifactId>jcp</artifactId>
                <version>5.3.3</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>preprocess</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
...
  </plugins>
</build>


Building
---------
The project needs Maven 3.0.3 and JDK 1.6 to be built. You have to enter the file path to your Maven directory in the configuration property 'maven.home' of the 'maven-failsafe-plugin' in the pom.xml.
It is a solid project without modules so that its inside testing (especialy for the maven part) looks a bit bizzare, may be it would be more rigth to implement as a project tree.
